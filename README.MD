# Rust raycaster

This is a simple raycaster written in Rust to learn the language. It is based on the [Lodev raycaster tutorial](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) and the DDA raycasting [tutorial](https://youtu.be/NbSee-XM7WA).

This project is not meant to be a full game engine, but rather a simple raycaster to learn Rust. I may be adding more features in the future if I feel like it.
